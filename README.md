Caneda Libraries Repository
===========================

This repository contains extra libraries and components for Caneda, ready to use. If you download a whole folder you can include it in your project by adding the folder as a library to Caneda.

In Caneda, libraries are folders with schematics and symbols inside. To use any library, you must download the selected folder and add it to your library list through the _Application Settings_ dialog in the _Libraries_ section. Any successive change in the library will be reflected upon the next program restart.
